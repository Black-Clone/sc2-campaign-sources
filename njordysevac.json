    "description": "Warning!<br>\n\n April 16, 2016<br>\n\n There have been some reports about bugs introduced with the 3.0 patch.<br>\n\n I have tested the original 6 missions and mission 5 have serious graphical glitches.\n\nWill try to fix asap.\n\n## Bio-Tech Company\n\n### **What is this?**\n\nBio-Tech Company is a singleplayer campaign for Starcraft 2.\n\n#### About\n\nOn this campaign I tried to make interesting and innovative missions with detailed terrain. Some missions have a radical different playstyle then regular Starcraft2 while others are more classical build and destroy (but with some twists). On one mission I used alot of WoW assets, the rest do only use SC2 assets.\n\nThese missions was made between April 2012 and August 2013. I learnt alot during this year and a half and I have had alot of fun. Thanks to the SC2mapster community for all help I have recieved during this time.\n\n**The original Bio-Tech Campaign does NOT require HotS**\n\n#### Current status<br>\n\n\n\nA new version of the campaign are now available. Be sure to report bugs and impressions in the comment field.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n I might make new updates if I recieve alot of bug reports or interesting ideas for improvement. However, the campaign played perfectly fine during my playthroughts so I don't expect bug reports to be numerous.\n\n### **Content**\n\n#### **The Bio-Tech Campaign**<br>\n\n\n\nThis is the newest version of the Bio-Tech Campaign. The zip contains 6 missions and 2 mod-files.\n\n[Download The Bio-Tech Campaign](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/media/files/811/959/BioTech.zip>)\n\n#### **BioTech Missions (HotS)**<br>\n\n\n\nREQUIRE HOTS<br>\n\n These are two standalone missions in a discontinued BioTech campaign.\n\n[Download Mission 01 and Mission 02](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/media/files/811/960/BioTech_HotS_Missions.zip>)\n\n**Other Projects**\n\n#### **The Ignos**<br>\n\n\n\nREQUIRE HOTS\n\nThe Ignos is a new protoss campaign I am working on.

I have few pals who are into Starcraft2, so I need feedback from you who dowload these missions. It would be very helpful if you could write a few sentences about the mission you liked the most and mission you liked the least. Thanks to all who contribute.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n",
