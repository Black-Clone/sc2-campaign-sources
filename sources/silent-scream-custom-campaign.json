    "description": "## Intro\n\nA Silent Scream is my first custom campaign. My nickname is IeZaeL , you might know me as the creator of some famous melee maps , such as Coda , that stayed in ladder for over 2 seasons and got played at Blizzcon 2015. Lately I lost passion putting hours of thoughts into a map layout only to find out it will never work, so I started creating a short adventure following the character of Ma'lash, a character that I really liked even though he did not really have a whole lot of story told/to tell. Little is known about Ma'lash past, so I could pretty much insert whatever I wanted into the story. I hope it will be enjoyable to play. It sure was to make.\n\n## The story and the Characters\n\nFollow the adventure of the Highlord Ma'lash before the Whispers of Oblivion events.
