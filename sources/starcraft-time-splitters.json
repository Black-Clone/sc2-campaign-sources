    "description": "## Preface.\n\nThis campaign is my first attempt for a project telling a story within the realm of SC2 and consisting of multiple singleplayer maps. I hope that I can provide you [player, streamer, watcher] with a fun and enjoyable experience.\nI also hope my mapmaking skills and time allow me to bring out the maps I want to tell within the story set for this campaign.\n\nAlso, should you encounter problems due to Blizzard updates or other, please let me know about them, then I&apos;ll try to fix all I can.\n\n------\n\n![](https://image.ibb.co/jjdJDo/SC_TS_M1_P1_Intro.jpg)\n\n&#xA0;\n\n## Starcraft: Time Splitters\n\nThe campaign will be set in the style of Time Splitters, and will introduce the [Protoss Talon faction](https://www.sc2mapster.com/projects/wingedarchon-assets/pages/wingedarchon-downloads-hub/protoss-factions/talon) as a playable race that is at the center of this campaign.\n\n## Story\n\n[History]\n\nWhile their history among the Protoss is largely shrouded in mystery, recorded history shows that the Talon have always been present at the beginning of momentous events, mostly resulting in a war-torn Protoss society. Near the end of the Aeon of Strife when Adun introduced the Khala, the Talon were amongst those who vicously opposed it. Even before the exile of the Nerazim, most of the Talon left Aiur in several supercarriers in order to found a new civilization of their own. Amongst those which were left behind they merged themselves in with the Nerazim and Tal&apos;Darim in order to learn and gather intel.\n\n[Time Splitters]\n\nFor decades the Talon have kept a shroud of silence around their existence ever since. Many of the mysteriously vanished expeditionary teams of Protoss and terrans alike are the result of relentless destruction by the Talon.&#xA0;However, while there were always tensions between the various subfactions of the Talon, during the last year tensions grew exponentially, leaving the Talon at the edge of a civil war. This story begins on a small backwater planet, where the Annual Combat Event -a yearly ritual for the establishment of Talon rule- is on the verge to begin...\n\n&#xA0;\n\n## How to install and play\n\n### ![](https://i.ibb.co/1TBRk0k/Wrench.jpg)Installing the maps\n\n1.
