    "description": "This Campaign aims to create an indeterminate quantity of levels based on the Hybrid and their story after the events of Legacy of the Void. The Campaign is a project directly supported and produced by the community with each level being built by a different map designer. This first mission acts as a demonstration of what we hope to accomplish. The second level is currently being worked on and we hope to expand and work towards more ambitious goals in the future, so stay tuned.\n\nCredits:\n\n[http://www.sc2mapster.com/profiles/yukaboy/](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/profiles/yukaboy/>) \"RedRook\"<br>\n\n[http://www.sc2mapster.com/profiles/SoulFilcher/](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/profiles/SoulFilcher/>)<br>\n\n[http://www.sc2mapster.com/profiles/Xan0/](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/profiles/Xan0/>)\n\n![http://i.imgur.com/eco4czG.jpg](<http://i.imgur.com/eco4czG.jpg>)<br>\n\n![http://i.imgur.com/7dywTlA.jpg](<http://i.imgur.com/7dywTlA.jpg>)<br>\n\n![http://i.imgur.com/BoMPbDR.jpg](<http://i.imgur.com/BoMPbDR.jpg>)<br>\n\n![http://i.imgur.com/MY1uFCX.jpg](<http://i.imgur.com/MY1uFCX.jpg>)\n\n",
