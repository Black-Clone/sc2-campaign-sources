    "description": "Hey guys,\n\nThis is a different type of map than what I have seen so far. It is not made to be extremely hard but simply to be a fun game for when you have 45min ish to kill. For all of you that like Sim games, and for those of you that enjoy Sim ants, well this is your lucky day ! The map allows you to build an ant colony from the ground up, managing your harvester force, your army force, and seeking food and territory.\n\nQuick feature list:<br>\n\n \\-Day/night cycle + Rain effects<br>\n\n \\- Gradually harder enemy ant colonies.<br>\n\n \\-Environmental dangers (Wasps, Humans walking around, water puddles, etc)<br>\n\n \\-Use of pheromones to help guide your workers towards food spots.<br>\n\n \\-Tutorial to help you through your first game.<br>\n\n \\-More?\n\nI want to stress that it is only in beta, and that only me and a friend have played it. I am looking for your feedback on the map, as well as bug reports. If it proves popular I may make another map with the same game, but using a different environment, or perhaps make it a multiplayer game where each player would have to fight for Grass domination.\n\nCurrent known issues:<br>\n\n \\-Red ant AI not always acting on cue.\n\nCheers, and have fun folks!\n\n![null](<http://img691.imageshack.us/img691/521/antsloadingscreen.jpg>)\n\n",
