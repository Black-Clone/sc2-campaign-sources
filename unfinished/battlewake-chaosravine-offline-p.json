(opposite positions are fairly balanced).\n\nFeel free to drop in your comments/critics that could help me adjust the maps or if you want more Battlewake Maps posted, please give me a heads-up, if I get enough requests I may then add in more maps for you to enjoy.\n\nTO PLAY THE GAME: double click the file to open map editor and click on the map test button (run map)\n\nTry other maps from Battlewake®\n\n**Chaosravine**[http://sc2.curse.com/downloads/sc2-maps/details/battlewake-chaosravine-offline-p.aspx](<http://sc2.curse.com/downloads/sc2-maps/details/battlewake-chaosravine-offline-p.aspx>)\n\n**Primalflow**[http://sc2.curse.com/downloads/sc2-maps/details/battlewake-primalflow-offline-pl.aspx](<http://sc2.curse.com/downloads/sc2-maps/details/battlewake-primalflow-offline-pl.aspx>)\n\n**Shattergrove**[http://sc2.curse.com/downloads/sc2-maps/details/battlewake-shattergrove.aspx](<http://sc2.curse.com/downloads/sc2-maps/details/battlewake-shattergrove.aspx>)\n\nHave Fun! -gvad\n\n",
