    "description": "\n\nThe Battlewake Collectives is a collection of highly detailed maps that aims to expand new terrain scenarios for you single-offline players out there This map is for single player off-line play and pits you in a 2 on 2 random race battle with an AI ally against 2 random AI opponents (very hard/insane) difficulties. maps are fairly balanced with 2 different mirrored handicapped starting positions. (opposite positions are fairly balanced).\n\nFeel free to drop in your comments/critics that could help me adjust the maps or if you want more Battlewake Maps posted, please give me a heads-up, if I get enough requests I may then add in more maps for you to enjoy.\n\nTO PLAY THE GAME: double click the file to open map editor and click on the map test button (run map)\n\nTry other maps from Battlewake®\n\n**Chaosravine**[http://sc2.curse.com/downloads/sc2-maps/details/battlewake-chaosravine-offline-p.aspx](<http://sc2.curse.com/downloads/sc2-maps/details/battlewake-chaosravine-offline-p.aspx>)\n\n**Primalflow**[http://sc2.curse.com/downloads/sc2-maps/details/battlewake-primalflow-offline-pl.aspx](<http://sc2.curse.com/downloads/sc2-maps/details/battlewake-primalflow-offline-pl.aspx>)\n\n**Shattergrove**[http://sc2.curse.com/downloads/sc2-maps/details/battlewake-shattergrove.aspx](<http://sc2.curse.com/downloads/sc2-maps/details/battlewake-shattergrove.aspx>)\n\nHave Fun! -gvad\n\n",
