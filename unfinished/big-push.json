    "description": "Hi guys. Unlike the last remake I did (that was kinda botched) this one more closely resembles the original. This is a remake of the SC1 mission with the same name where you start with all your main buildings flying. You'll be happy to hear that all transmissions are in here good, none of the audio was missing this time. (\"Ah can't believe this! Alpha Squadron woulda never left this equipment behind! That's what ah call sloppy!\") The triggers for victory and defeat are fine too, but there is one little quirk. There is a Nexus on an \"island\" on the map's outer edge. DO NOT DESTROY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you do, the game will end before the transmissions play, and you'll have to hit \"return to game\" to view them. Anyway, for those of you who prefer to wait for your upgrades, the times are back to normal. (Besides, it's a pain in the butt to go in and alter the time of each individual upgrade anyway. Hopefully Wings of Liberty will have the operation cwal code so I won't have to do that.) Duke is featured in the Norad 3, a battlecruiser. So let me know what u think of this one.\n\n\n\n",
