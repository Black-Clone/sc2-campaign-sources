    "description": "During the expansion of the old confederacy a science center was founded... and lost. However the people inside the science center kept up on there experiments evolving there technology well beyond the rest of the universe as they where unencumbered by war. Then one day a protoss carrier crash landed on this planet. They where taken prisoner and tested upon for years until one day, a tube broke and the tests they where carrying out on subject 7 proved to be the worst mistake these scientists had ever made.\n\nThis will be the first in a series of rpg maps being developed by Final Federation! It will be a from a tps view as you play as the main character Zarith (aka subject 7) as you try to escape from the prison and use your new found powers to reap vengeance on your captors! this map is in very early development and i am deffinetly looking for people to work on it with me <span>:D</span>\n\n if you wanna help drop me a pm!\n\n",
