No one knows why the Zerg have all of a sudden become so aggressive. Arcturus himself assigned General King's forces to set up orbital defenses in high orbit above Castanar to push the Zerg back. Arcturus also ordered Victor Von to assist General King in his defense, and any rebels they may encounter.\n\n\n\nThis is my first campaign within the Starcraft 2 Galaxy Editor. I have to say, it has been a long but fun journey so far. I've always enjoyed playing Wings of Liberty, Heart of the Swarm, and Legacy of the Void. Also, I enjoy playing campaigns made by the public. This is my first campaign, but it will not be my last.\n\n## **<span style=\"color:#f00\">Feedback</span>\n\n**\n\nIf you have any feedback you would like to give me, leave it in the comments\n\nor [Shadow of Liberty Feedback](<https://www.sc2mapster.com/forums/player-zone/map-feedback/180975-starcraft-ii-shadow-of-liberty-feedback#c15>)\n\n## **<span style=\"color:#f00\">How To Install</span>\n\n**\n\n1\\.
