Everything was set into motion when Amon was revived. The Tal'darim were slaves of the dead god but Ras'Gul denied. As a punishment, Amon infested Ras'Gul with his shadows. However, once again, Ras'Gul denies. He was sent into exile, into the void. But after Amon's death, he prepared himself, for his revenge!
