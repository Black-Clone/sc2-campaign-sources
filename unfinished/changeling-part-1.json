    "description": "The first mission of a campaign I am making. This map is very short and it isn't done yet and probably has a lot of bugs. The next levels will be much much larger.\n\nYou play a changeling, on a mission to enter an underground terran facility while the base is overrun by Zerg. You can take the form of a zergling and marine to fool either the zerg or the terrans.\n\n",
