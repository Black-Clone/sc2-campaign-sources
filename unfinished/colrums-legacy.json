I'm still working on Red Sand Planet, but due to a lot of errors appearing while I try to remake that map I've delayed release for some time. But during that time I've made a Much! (lolsguy, I started small!:)) more smaller map to play. Send me a message if you notice some bugs or errors. Hope you enjoy it. In some time I will continue Red Sand and this one, will you enjoy them or not:))\n\nUpdate(20.09.11): I remade primary objectives. The game didn't change much thou, but now it's more clear what you Need to do.\n\n",
