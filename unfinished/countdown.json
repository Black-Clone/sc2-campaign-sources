    "description": "This is a remake of the final Protoss mission in Brood War;the mission where you must bring Zeratul and Artanis to the Xel'Naga temple and then hold out against the Zerg. I am relatively new to map-making...so the triggers are relatively simple and there may be a few minor bugs or errors...but nothing game-breaking. Overall, I think this is better than my last Brood War remake (The Ruins of Tarsonis)...and I'm fairly content with it. Feel free to tell me what you think.\n\n",
