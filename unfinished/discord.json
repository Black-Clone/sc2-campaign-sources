    "description": "\n\n## What is Discord?\n\nDiscord is a custom fan made campaign. When it's done it will have 30 missions and cover 3 interwoven stories. For now I only have the first few missions completed and ready for testing. You can download them here by going to the files tab and selecting the files for download. The files need to be placed in your Starcraft II directory to work properly. I would suggest that you start with the launcher map when you play.\n\n## Who am I?\n\nI am Baelethal, a long time lurker on sc2mapster. I have visited this site many times since wings of liberty came out, but only now I have decided to finally participate in the community. This is my first project for Starcraft II and my first activity on sc2mapster. I hope to remain active for some time to come and to create many projects to add to sc2mapster. Please enjoy what Discord and I have to offer.\n\n## Why would you want to play?\n\nDiscord has many features to catch your interest.\n\n- Has a customized tech tree with multiplayer + official campaign + custom units \n- Nice custom terrain \n- Unique never before seen story \n- Multiple difficulty levels \n- Play as Umojans \n- Custom Music <br>\n\n     <br>\n\n\n<!-- -->\n\n# Mission Progress\n\n### Terran\n\n- Mission 1 - Ghost Towns (Released) \n- Mission 2 - Raven's Pass (Released) \n- Mission 3 - Siege of Darkness (Released) \n- Mission 4 - A Ghost From The Past (Released) \n- Mission 5 - From The Shadows (Beta) \n- Mission 6 - Unwanted Visitors (Work in Progress) \n- Mission 7 - Warbirds (Planning) \n- Mission 8 - The Head of The Snake (Planning) \n- Mission 9 - Burning Crops (Planning) \n- Mission 10 - Off The Record (Planning) \n\n<!-- -->\n\n### Zerg\n\n- None \n\n<!-- -->\n\n### Protoss\n\n- None \n\n<!-- -->\n\n# Video\n\nThis video is from awhile ago and lacks the custom music in the maps which should be available now.\n\n# Screenshots\n\n\n\n# Feedback\n\nPlease help me improve Discord.<br>\n\n- [Feedback Thread](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/forums/player-zone/map-feedback/85104-discord-a-custom-campaign-for-starcraft-ii/>)<br>\n\n    <br>\n\n\n<!-- -->\n\n# Custom Campaign Initiative\n\nVisit The Custom Campaign Initiative to find more custom campaigns like this one, and give support to other mapmakers. <br>\n\n[Link to Custom Campaign Initiative](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/maps/custom-campaign-initiative/>)\n\n# Thanks to\n\n- All testers who have provided feedback such as Deltronlive, SamsaraNoMas, Terhonator, BeaverVonHupfburg, Captain\\_Kaos, and olcharlieboi. \n- Alleyviper85 for the umojan marine, umojan guard, umojan predator, Marine Marauder, and [umojan frostbat](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/assets/av-model-reinforces/files/128-umoja-frostbat/>) models. <br>\n\n- Ghostnova91 for the [umojan marine](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/assets/ghostnovas-mods/files/63-umojan-marine/>) and [umojan shadowguard](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/assets/ghostnovas-mods/files/62-umojan-shadow-guard-and-black-ops-spectre/>) models. <br>\n\n- Alleyviper85 and Hammer107 for the Mirahan Marine model. \n- SoulFilcher for wireframes and icons <br>\n\n- Kanitala, and Thrikodias for other custom models and textures used in this mod. <br>\n\n- The composers at [Newgrounds.com](</linkout?remoteUrl=http%253a%252f%252fwww.newgrounds.com%252faudio%252f>) for the custom music \n- EivindL for his [Perfect Soldiers](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/maps/perfect-soldiers/>) trilogy which inspired me to start this project. <br>\n\n- [The Custom Campaign Initiative](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/maps/custom-campaign-initiative/>) for bringing custom campaign creators together and supporting them and their creations. \n- [Deltronlive](<https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu5kRp46oLzWek-SRGljTRA/featured>) for his [video playthrough](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-ztMTjyPOQ&index=1&list=PLlC8YfRpYfL3_cNe_yoc5VRAsSx63ohtg>) of these maps and for giving extremely helpful feedback in the form of those videos. <br>\n\n- [Jayborino](<https://www.youtube.com/user/JayborinoPlays>) for showing off the work of this community. <br>\n\n- Everyone else for keeping this community alive for so long.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n",
