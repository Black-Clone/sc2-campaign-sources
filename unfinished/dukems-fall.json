    "description": "3vs1 where three people are buffed up thors in TPS mode defending a base from the other player who is Protoss in RTS mode with limited tech and supplies. Has imba cannons defending protoss base so assaulting it is impossible. Protoss must destroy the Castle Uberstein before timer runs out. Thors controls are wsad move, left click hand cannons, right click anti air and middle mouse flamethrower. To target just get the camera (not the unit) to point toward what your shooting at.\n\nExperimental map, on battlenet please feel free to offer suggestions. may plan a bigger version with more players at a later date. Needs playtesting for balance.\n\nCredit where due many thanks to Qancakes your perdition map was the inspiration. Studying your map realy help me solve alot of the problems I was having getting a TPS to work, I take my hat off to you sir.\n\n",
