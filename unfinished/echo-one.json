    "description": "You are Echo One, a lone operative deployed to search the future streets of Moscow for a lab containing an artifact or archive of some sort. This urban war zone will be filled with enemies of varying type as well as a few allies. With the world on the brink of destruction, it is vital that you do not fail.\n\nAuthor's Comment: This is my first map ever created and I just wanted people's opinions about it. Expect it to be really buggy. You won't be able to understand the storyline because I'm planning on making a campaign of four more maps in the near future sequencing off of this one. This is also my first time experimenting with a TPS engine.\n\n",
