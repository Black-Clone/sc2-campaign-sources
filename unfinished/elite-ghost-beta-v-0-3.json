    "description": "Control an Elite Ghost that is capable of taking out anything in his way. You are sent in to investigate an area that the Protoss are using to create a secret weapon. You must navigate the area, take out any opposition in your way, find and destroy the weapon.\n\nThis is my first shot ever at create a legit map/scenario in any game, strategy or otherwise. I am new to the whole trigger editing deal so it took me a while to sort everything out as I have never done this kind of stuff before. It was fun creating it and I hope you guys enjoy!\n\nI still consider it a beta because I'd still like to tighten some stuff up if possible. Known Issues: - Camera is off center when moving to custom made lower ground, also noticeable when using nuke (cursor is not centered in the target area), game has no way of knowing that custom made lower terrain is actually lower or higher, working on finding a fix\n\n",
