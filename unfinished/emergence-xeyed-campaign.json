    "description": "The Xeyed are a creation of Umojan scientists that eventually proved to be too dangerous to contain. The Umojans attempted to exterminate all of the Xeyed, but a xeyed agent, Cazlazc, escaped to a distant planet with several Scavengers(Miner/Builder unit) with the genetic plans for every xeyed strain created stored in it's mind. The first mission begins with you on planet Clyvan, as you rebuild and make contact with hostile tribalists.\n\nPlease note that I don't have a whole lot of time, so expect development to be slow.\n\n",
