    "description": "## Key Of life Details\n\nThe key of life is the artifact looked at again, and discover'd there are still missing pieces. These pieces were scatter'd around the galaxy much like how the first three were, but randomly. most of them fell to the zerg and with the queen now neutralized, these pieces have become useless with the zerg. and will need these pieces for the full power of the artifact to stop an upcoming danger.\n\n#### Episodes\n\nEpisode one: The key of life (zombie Survival with 3 boss triggers) (link: [http://www.sc2mapster.com/maps/ep1-key-life/](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/maps/ep1-key-life/>))\n\nEpisode two: They found us\n\nEpisode three: Relocate\n\nEpisode Four: The heat of battle\n\nEpisode five: a new mutation\n\nEpisode six: Incarnations\n\nEpisode seven: The cataclysm\n\n###### note\n\n*The first episode does not have many coding or events, other then bosses and waves. Second episode i am currently working on will be way better in interface and cut scenes. as i get to know more about the editor :p you will notice it right away when the next episode is released. *\n\nthank you.\n\n",
