    "description": "Hey guys, I have something new for you: the last mission in SC1 where you kill the Overmind, only with the actual terrain of the Overmind's resting place from the 3rd mission of the Protoss mini-campaign in WoL! The chasm with the dead overmind is filled in and gone with the living overmind and a huge Zerg base/army in it's place. You control both Protoss and Terran forces like in the original, with the Terrans at the site in the lower right side since in the 3rd mission of the Protoss mini-campaign in WoL there was an infested Terran base there. The Protoss base is where it is in that mission as well. To make things very special, I used the SC1 mod made by Ultraling and those other guys, and I give full credit to them for the impressive mod. The original voices for Aldaris, Raynor, and Tassadar are in the transmissions of course. Enjoy!\n\n\n\n",
