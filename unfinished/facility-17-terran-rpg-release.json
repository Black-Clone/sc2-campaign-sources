    "description": "The map is a turn-based RPG, reminiscent of FF7, based in the starcraft universe (did you know you aren'tt allowed to publish maps with the word \"starcraft\" in the description? crazy, eh?). Your party consists of 3 characters each with their own special abilities, upgrades, and limit breaks, and you fight through 10 unique battles, with intermittent cutscenes to advance the story.\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VbNgA0si1o8?wmode=transparent\" height=\"358\" width=\"638\"></iframe>\n\nPlease email any feedback to Greythepirate@gmail.com\n\n",
