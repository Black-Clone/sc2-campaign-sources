Thanks, Ctdaugherty\n\n[FULL REMAKE FILES - GO HERE FOR MOST UP-TO-DATE VERSIONS - SC:MASS RECALL](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/maps/starcraft-mass-recall/>)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n- [SC1 Terran Campaign: Rebel Yell](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/maps/sc1-episode-1-rebel-yell/>)\n\n<!-- -->\n\n- [SC1 Zerg Campaign: Overmind](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/maps/sc1-episode-2-overmind/>)\n\n<!-- -->\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n- [SCBW Protoss Campaign: The Stand](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/maps/sc1-episode-4-stand/>)\n\n<!-- -->\n\n- [SCBW Terran Campaign: The Iron Fist](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/maps/sc1-episode-5-iron-fist/>)\n\n<!-- -->\n\n- [SCBW Zerg Campaign: Queen of Blades](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/maps/sc1-episode-6-queen-blades/>)\n\n<!-- -->\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\nIf the 'Download' link does not take you to the right place, click on \"Files\" in the navigation bar above and you can get to the downloads.\n\nThese maps are based on the above SC1 mod/maps by [maverck](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/profiles/maverck/>) and work by Blizzard (of course) and [Ultraling](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/profiles/Ultraling/>) and [Jones313](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/profiles/Jones313/>). They are fully backward-compatible with the previous Terran and Zerg campaign maps. Many thanks, props and much love to all who contributed. I could NEVER have completed this project without all their hard work.\n\nAlso thanks to [Forsworne](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/profiles/Forsworne/>) for the non-glowy Tassadar model and [b0ne123](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/profiles/b0ne123/>) for the Kerrigan and Tassadar Hero Icons.\n\nSpecial thanks as well to [Telenil](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/profiles/Telenil/>) who has been quite helpful with detailed descriptions of errors and issues; also to [Superfield](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/profiles/Superfield/>) and [Jimm3110](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/profiles/Jimm3110/>) for all the feedback and suggestions. Some of the changes and improvements would not have been done without these good fellows.\n\nThese maps are a labor of love. I learned the SC2 Editor on my own, through inference and other maps. These maps took about 6 months to complete in my spare time.\n\n***I am interested in the possibility of being a professional programmer, developer, or game designer.***\n\n***I have not made these maps seeking to make any profit nor do I claim any ownership over the contents. Most of the work was done in advance by Blizzard and the people who made the SC1 Terran and Zerg campaigns. ***\n\nThat being said, if you like the maps please donate on my SC2Mapster page. Thanks and enjoy.\n\nThese maps are meant to be re-creations of the original game. I have added/tweaked a number of things from the original SC1mod.SC2mod file. I have included some small surprises as well in the maps, if you explore a bit.\n\nI would like to thank all you dedicated players of StarCraft and RTS's without which this project would be pointless. I hope you all can enjoy these maps as much as I do. En Taro Adun!\n\n4/48/2013 - Is everyone else enjoying Heart of the Swarm as much as I am?? Fantastic campaign, Blizzard. So many good things about it, even if I don't want to spoil it for you, I might spoil it just by mentioning them... Anyhow, just an update, I am finishing school right now so in a few weeks I will have more time to pick these up again and make some more tweaks. Thanks for your patience people.\n\n5/15/2014 - It has been a while since I last posted here, but I just wanted to inform everyone that I will be back to rebalance/debug the maps and mods once the final (Protoss) expansion is out. I haven't played SC2 that much since I got hooked on GuildWars 2 (a game I highly recommend if you like RPGs or WoW-style quest games), but I am eagerly awaiting the new expansion so you will likely see more of me once that happens. Cheers!\n\n4/1/2012 - Final versions of Maps posted.\n\nNew Zerg Maps 4 & 5 (non-fps): [Zerg 4 & 5](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/maps/sc1-modded-zerg-maps-4-5/pages/main/>) (someday)\n\n***PLEASE NOTE - UNZIP THE MAPS TO YOUR \"MAPS\" FOLDER, THEY SHOULD BE IN A FOLDER NAMED \"3. THE FALL\".***\n\nChris\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n[Changelog](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/maps/fall-protoss-legacy-sc1-campaign/files/35-change-log-file/>)\n\nScreenshots: [Screenshots](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/maps/fall-protoss-legacy-sc1-campaign/images/>)\n\nRussian Mod: [Russian Mod](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/maps/sc1-episode-4-stand/files/7-sc1-mod-v4-1-russian/>)\n\nZipped Maps Latest: [Maps V.
