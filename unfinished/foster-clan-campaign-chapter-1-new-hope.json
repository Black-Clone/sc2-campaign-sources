    "description": "This is the story about 'Foster clan' - clan of alcoholics. Unforunately their home planet is all out of beer! For past few years, foster clan is desparately trying to acquire some beer, without any success. But today, foster clan captured unknown signal which is believed to lead to ancient beer recipe. But it won't be so easy - planet is occupied by other clan as well, clan that is happy about no-beer situation - for Foster clan known as 'Teetotallers' - and they will do everything in their power to keep their planet 'clean'. Take control of Foster Clan and help them acquire some beer!\n\n\n\nYou can play this map straight from game... find the map by visiting arcade and searching for 'Foster'\n\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n\\- Play as terran only\n\n\\- 5 difficulty levels ('Casual' 'Medium' 'Hard' 'Brutal' and 'Impossible (almost)')\n\n\\- sort of funny little plot\n\n\\- campaign units\n\n\n\nThis is my first public campaign project and even tho i'm still learning to work with editor, i believe i created playable and enjoyable map. I'm also sorry for potential grammar mistakes, as english is not my main language and i'm still learning.\n\n\n\nCurrent plans:\n\n\\- work on bug fixes and balance of chapter 2 & 3\n\n\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\n\nEDIT (March 2019):\n\nChapter 2 and 3 BETA versions are now available on battle.net in arcade (search \"foster\") (EU-server only for now)\n\n",
