Again, be sure to have tip notifications enabled, and simple command card disabled.\n\nHere it is folks, the second part of the frigate Orpheon in Metroid Prime. Starring infested Terrans as injured pirates, auto turrets as auto defense turrets, and Reapers as uninjured pirates. A realistic Biohazard Containment features the original \"Fall of Zebes\" data entry as a tip (make sure you've enabled tip notifications) and a Command Center portrait. Enjoy the map, tell me what you think.\n\n\n\n",
