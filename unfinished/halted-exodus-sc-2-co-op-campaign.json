    "description": "## Exodus\n\n**Starcraft 2 Cooperative Campaign - STAGNANT PROJECT**\n\n### A quick brief\n\n*Raynor and Fenix had chosen to stay in the Protoss homeworld deteriorated by the devastation of the Zerg invasion. As the Executor of the remaining Protoss forces and the commander of the Hyperion, Is your responsibility to extract from Aiur as much Protosses as possible.*\n\n---\n\n- *Mission 1: \"The other side\"*: Down from the arcade. I'll reupload it eventually. \n\n\n\n- *Mission 2: \"Power down\"*: Down from the arcade. I'll reupload it eventually \n\n\n\n- *Mission 3: \"Aiur Caverns\"*: Not uploaded yet \n\n\n\n- *Mission 4: \"Surrounded\".*: Not uploaded yet \n\n\n\n- *Mission 5: \"Tame the swarm\".*: Not uploaded yet \n\n\n\n- *Mission 6: \"The egress\".*: Not uploaded yet \n\n\n\n- *Mission 7: \"Augustgrad's Backdoor\".*: Down from the arcade. I'll reupload it eventually \n\n\n\n- *Mission 8: \"Exodus\".*: Not uploaded yet \n\n\n\n---\n\n### Features\n\n- 8 **cooperative **missions. In most of them one player will control Raynor's Raiders and the other a force in charge of Fenix. There's also a Zerg mission and 2 micro-intensive ones. \n- Introductory text, Briefing, and a score screen to make the game a bit competitive. \n- SC/ SCBW original music. Planning adding custom (or alternative) soundtracks for the cinematics. \n- Oficial characters. Is intended to make it lore friendly. \n- **Personalized tech tree.**\n- The game uses the models and the units of SCR-TGW, a modified version of **Maverck's SCBWMod**. \n\n\n\n### Status\n\nThis project is currently **stagnant**. It's the one I've started when I got into mapmaking, and right now I realize that it was very ambitious for my skills at that moment.\n\nI'm occasionally working over the project foundations (mod, functions, UI, script), and I've restarted the design of the first 3 maps, so there's no content to show. I expect reviving my work during 2018, and start having something to share by the end of that year.\n\n- *Mission 1: \"The other side\"* 30% complete. 2nd. iteration, Just the layout, UI and the basic mechanic were finished. \n\n\n\n- *Mission 2: \"Power down\"* 50% complete. 2nd. iteration. Terrain, Briefing, UI and half of the scripted events completed. Working on stage design, fixing cinematics and AI. \n\n\n\n- *Mission 3: \"Aiur Caverns\"* 60% complete. 3rd. iteration. Advanced progress in the terrain, and minigames. Working on a bridging mechanic. \n\n\n\n- *Mission 4: \"Surrounded\".* Only scripted. \n\n\n\n- *Mission 5: \"Tame the swarm\".* Only scripted. \n\n\n\n- *Mission 6: \"The egress\".* Only scripted. \n\n\n\n- *Mission 7: \"Augustgrad's Backdoor\".* 10% Complete. Thinking in making a new iteration. \n\n\n\n- *Mission 8: \"Exodus\".* Only scripted. \n\n\n\n### Known Bugs\n\n### Miscellaneous\n\n- If somebody wants to participate in the project in the future, please let me know.\n\n\n\n",
