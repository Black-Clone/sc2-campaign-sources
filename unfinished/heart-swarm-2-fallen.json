    "description": "Hi guys. I recently updated the last mission, so if you didn't already, download and play the new file. Anyway, here is the second mission, and I want to say something right off the bat: I am powerless in the cinematics arena, so some story evens that would best be told thru them will instead have to be told thru loading screens. So I don't want to hear you yelling about it, ok? Anyway, in this is a good old kill-everything-on-the-map scenario. Destroy the enemy brood and victory is yours. Remember what I said in the description of the last mission about the transmissions, though. Enjoy!\n\n\n\n",
