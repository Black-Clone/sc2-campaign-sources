    "description": "I uploaded the second mission a while ago, apparently it went unnoticed. Anyway, here is the third mission. It starts with a fairly simple cutscene. You must bring Stetmann to each overmind terndril much like with Zeratul in WoL, but with one difference: because I suck so much at triggers, you must bring him to them in a certain order. When you build a hatchery (so make sure your drones don't die before you get to your base site) he will tell you the first one, and will point out the next one after each successive one. Make sure none of your heroes dies, or you lose. When the game starts, go to the place where your base was in the 3rd Zeratul mission in WoL, and you will find it there being run by the Shel'na Krythas (Those Who Endure) including Vartanil, one of the DTT protoss who was not in the fourth zeratul mission. Step onto the beacon in front of him and he will show you the site for your base. Tell me what you think of this mission and enjoy! (Keep an eye out for a cinematic map I will upload shortly after this one.)\n\n![null](<http://static.sc2mapster.com/content/images/24/654/Untitled.jpg>)\n\n",
