    "description": "This is my attempt at making the first mission of HotS based on the footage Blizzard has recently released to the public. It features the actual voice acting from that footage, ripped straight from it. You can even go to the birthing pond to get 20 banelings, just like in the video! Tech tree limitations are you can't build a spire or infestation pit, nor can you go to Hive level. Please comment and enjoy!\n\n![http://static.sc2mapster.com/content/images/32/461/Untitled.jpg](<http://static.sc2mapster.com/content/images/32/461/Untitled.jpg>)\n\n",
