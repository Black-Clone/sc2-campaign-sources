    "description": "*Mission 3 Released!*\n\n**Story: ** It is the year 2615, humanity on the outskirts of the Koprulu sector struggle to fight a renegade Zerg swarm, controlled only by a queen known as \"The Mother\". As the battle between Terran and Zerg continues, a military group, named \"The Hand of Dawn\" is humanity's last hope at crushing the Zerg-Infested threat. Recently however, the Hand of Dawn has been hard-pressed to find any solution to dealing with the presence of the Mother's Brood, and because of this, Dawn technicians and strategists have been pushed to develop a brand-new combat AI, which, if implemented, should greatly enhance all of the existing mech's combat systems, and prove a worthy and much-needed asset to the war effort. Unfortunately, the Zerg seem to have noticed this prioritized effort, and have been bombarding the local planet (Naar) with numerous forces, causing planet-wide terror and distress. Commander Cain Monahue; a well-respected commander and war veteran, has been appointed to deal with the Zerg threat on Naar, and ensure that the new combat AI is safe, secure, delivered, and implemented. Whether or not the Commander can face this task, that is up to you. With the thousands of innocent people dying on Naar and throughout nearby colonies, time is running short and failure is not an option.
