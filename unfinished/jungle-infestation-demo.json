    "description": "A demo of a fullscale project. It is similar to Resident Overmind - I know, that's because I based it off of that with a few tweaks of my own. The map itself is completely different trigger wise, I bet. In the demo you wander a long road that twists and turns throughout a jungle as a Ghost in the middle of the night, fighting zerg along the way. It's very simplified and will probably get more depth later if I decide to continue with it.\n\n",
