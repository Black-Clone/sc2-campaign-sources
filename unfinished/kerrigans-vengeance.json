    "description": "Raynor's Raiders are on the brink of activating the Xel'Naga relic on Char! Undo the damage the Terrans have inflicted on the homeworld of the Swarm and push Raynor's forces back so you can destroy him once and for all!\n\nThis is a single-player mission, similar in style to DOTA. Kerrigan must destroy the Terran's base guarding the Xel'Naga artifact. There are multiple secondary objectives around the map to aid Kerrigan in her conquest. Use earned minerals to upgrade your troops and beef up base defenses.\n\n**INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN**<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Drag the map file onto the Starcraft 2 executable <br>\n\n<br>\n\n**OR**<br>\n\n<br>\n\nOpen the map in the Starcraft 2 Galaxy Editor<br>\n\n Press Ctrl+F9 to run it.\n\n",
