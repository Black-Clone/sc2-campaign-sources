    "description": "This is a project I and some friends started some time ago. Now the project is on ice. I only have 2 ½ map, but check it out if you want.\n\nIts a \"what if\" campaign. It tells the story about what if Kerrigan had died at the hands of Narud.\n\nIts fully voiced, but as it is our first campaign some voiceacting may be of, that goes for some sound quality too =).\n\nI am using a custom model that I don´t know the owner of, but credit to you whom maybe recognize it. If it is not ok for me to use it, please PM me.\n\nCredits to Anki and Magnus whom helped me with the voices.\n\nMap 3 has no voices, but I release it cause its the most fub of the three.\n\nI hope you enyoj and please leave a comment.\n\n",
