    "description": "**Welcome to Legacy of the Confederation (\"LotC\")'s base of operations on SC2 Mapster**. LotC first appeared in 1999 and 2000 with 21 missions for a primary single player campaign, fully voiced. A mini-campaign (\"Fallen Angel\") was created a couple years later. We have now resumed work on the LotC campaign for SC2\n\nIf you want to 'see' the SC 1 / BW campaigns without having to spend hours of technical maneuvering to get them to work on your system, please refer to our community reviewer [JayBorino](<https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMmfhvBzj4FDvPTcm_rp98D-zFAWzxwLr>)'s channel.\n\n\\- [LotC Episode 1 (Past Purposes)](</linkout?remoteUrl=http%253a%252f%252fwww.campaigncreations.org%252fstarcraft%252flegacy_of_the_confederation%252fpast_purposes>)\n\n\\- [LotC Episode 2 (Dawn of Darkness)](</linkout?remoteUrl=http%253a%252f%252fwww.campaigncreations.org%252fstarcraft%252flegacy_of_the_confederation%252fdawn_of_darkness>)\n\n\\- [LotC Mini-Campaign (Fallen Angel)](</linkout?remoteUrl=http%253a%252f%252fwww.campaigncreations.org%252fstarcraft%252flegacy_of_the_confederation%252ffallen_angel>)\n\n\\- [PC Gamer Article Referencing LotC Back in the Day](</linkout?remoteUrl=http%253a%252f%252ffiles.campaigncreations.org%252fsc2%252flotc-3%252fpcgamer.jpg>)\n\n*\"...Legacy of the Confederation is so gripping that many consider it as good as Brood War...\" - Quote from PC Gamer Article*\n\nIf you want to give the campaigns a 'go', you can visit CampaignCreations.org (at the links above) for the downloads. (If you have issues getting the files set up, JayBorino also has a great tutorial written about this). Just remember you will need the original StarCraft 1 and Broodwar games installed regardless of any other technical wizardry is required.\n\n**\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\***\\*\\*\n\nClick [THIS LINK](</linkout?remoteUrl=http%253a%252f%252faddons-origin.cursecdn.com%252ffiles%252f902%252f127%252fUPL_-_Memorandum_10-16-2248.pdf>) as a quick gimmie.\n\nDestiny Awaits.\n\n**\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\***\\*\\*\n\nWant More Info? It's Nothing Newly Posted, however when the campaign was in production in 2010, here are some YouTube links to give you a teaser of things to come.\n\n[Link to YouTube video which shows how the first mission of LotC: Episode 2 might play out in SC2 vs. SC1](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jH4UEOYaeY>)\n\n*It will be awhile before this Episode actually hits cyberspace in any form. We decided to move forward with Episode 1 after all and complete the entire series of LotC in SC2 after we began work on Strike First, Striker Harder (The Mission Title for Episode 2's opener).*\n\n[FMV Teaser from 2009 (The First Teaser Released for LotC)](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSX2KZidFlU>)\n\n[Link to first draft of buildings that might appear in LotC.](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJiGvaKjE_s>) *After further review, these buildings will be moved to Episode 1 for use in the Past Purposes campaign and Episodes 2 and 3 will have a different set of buildings*\n\n**\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\*****\\***\\*\\*\n\n",
