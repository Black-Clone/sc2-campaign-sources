    "description": "This is the first mission of my take on Legacy of the Void so you won't have to wait 3 more years. In this first mission, Niadra attacks the Protoss on Shakuras with her infested ship and you have to kill her. This map features a Selendis High Templar unit I made using Lasarra's model and Karass as the rest. Selendis's transmissions are text, but Niadra has her audio dialogue from the game. You can build and research everything except the 3rd tier of ground attack/armor/shields at the Forge and the Stargate and fleet beacon and all the units that go with it, as well as all 3 levels of air upgrades. Enjoy!\n\n\n\n",
