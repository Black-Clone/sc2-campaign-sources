    "description": "Since the unveiling of LotV at Blizzcon 2014 has made my original campaign null and void, here is the first mission of my reboot. (Nova's missions will remain as a side story, and I will reupload them eventually.) You start with a massive army and fleet befitting the mission, and can research everything. Your goal is to wipe out the Zerg, and when you are finished, Amon makes his presence known. Enjoy!\n\n\n\n",
