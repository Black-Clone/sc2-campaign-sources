    "description": "The second mission of Legacy of the Void. In this one you have a base with all the essentials (though you cannot build a stargate or any units thereof) and 5000 minerals and vespene. There is a vast army of hybrids, Destroyers and Reavers both, spread across the map, which is why I gave you such an advantage. Your goal is to fight your way thru them and kill their leader Umaroth, who waits at the Tal'darim base. You have Raynor's Raiders as a computer ally for this mission.\n\nP.S. For those who know where I got Umaroth's name from, I had to think of something, and something which most people wouldn't recognize. And yes, I'm a huge Inheritance fan and proud of it, even if I don't know much of the ancient language. ;)\n\n![null](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/media/images/54/610/Untitled.jpg>)\n\n",
