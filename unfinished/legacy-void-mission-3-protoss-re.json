    "description": "The third mission in Legacy of the Void. You are on Korhal IV, with the same map as the last HotS mission, and have a large base with plenty of resources to eliminate the hybrids and Forged all over the city. You have Kerrigan and her brood as an ally and can control Zeratul. You also have Artanis (meaning you can have TWO motherships) and Selendis. Enjoy!\n\n\n\n",
