    "description": "Little Unit, Big Map is a gorgeously dark & stylish adventure. Control a tiny weak unit who isn't in much combat directly, yet there is plenty of action.\n\nThe factions are the reward of this map. You get to be part of a sophisticated & well designed faction but after you complete their grand quest.\n\nPlus a balanced, intense final boss fight, plenty of platforming & dreary land wandering.\n\nMain characters:\n\n- Little Unit, weak ultimate explorer & treasure hunter \n- Elder, leader Temple of Eons, wise summoner \n- Old Lord Calypso, leader of Luster, speaks ancient tongue \n- Egg Keeper, creepy ally \n- Tyrant, demi-god of destruction \n- Adrige, leader of Science Faction, his inventions are masterful \n\n<!-- -->\n\n\n\nPlaces:\n\n- Temple of Eons, ancient and dark, timeless feel. Game starts on Elder's Tower. \n- Science Faction, quirky grinding gears, massive pipes & anything to do with science. \n- Luster, complexly layered old-world insectoid city. \n- Star's Plenty, floating utopia, main city. \n- Twisted Dimension, a mind-bending twisted ancient mega-structure. \n- Desert of Despair, an enthralling maze of sand \n- Volcano, a fully working volcano, sealed by an ancient gate, in the volcanic core is none another than Pandora's Box! \n\n<!-- -->\n\n\n\nDevelopment:\n\n- complete \n\n<!-- -->\n\nNotes:\n\n- most file size is from terrain\n\n<!-- -->\n\n",
