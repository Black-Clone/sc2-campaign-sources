The chosen-one who is the Ranger must stay alive at the hole scenario-mission. You and your Deputy-Ranger have orders to patrol this Mar Sara Colony, to prevent the crime and rumors about Zerg-activities. The scenario consists of small mission-quests you have to reach, to go on in the storyline.\n\n",
