His family is poor, he want to get money for them. So he joined the Marine Corps and meets friends, who stamp his life...\n\n(Sorry for bad english)\n\nThis is his story.\n\nHow it said, i will make a campaign of raynors life from the beginning to the end of the marine corps. -> Many Cinematics, because its build on the Books of Starcraft. (Heavens Devils etc.)\n\n",
