    "description": "On this map you will face other players in a match to the death. It's recomemded you play this map on FFA or Melle or Team FFA but it's most fun with FFA and beware there are a lot of minerals but a low amount of vespine gas. Keep in mind your ememies are close by. And don't let your guard down because there multiple enterances into your base. Oh and be aware that there are at least several cut throughts throughout the map so you can use those to spare you some time while you tech. It's very possible for you to rush someone especially zergling rushes and photon rushes so watch out in the early game unless your rushing yourself. Dont forget the photon rushes are the most effective because of all the cut throughts and the large size of the bases starting points.",
