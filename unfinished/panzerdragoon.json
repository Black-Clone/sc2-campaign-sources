    "description": "\\~ Placeholder for future content \\~\n\nOne of the greatest game series I ever played is Panzer Dragoon and with hope and some luck, I can bring this playstyle to the SC2 engine. The premise of the map is you play a 360-spin turret style unit that is constantly on the move firing at enemies coming from all around. I will try to utilize the dragon-transformation from light, medium, and heavy forms as well as an RPG element of leveling and choosing which dragon forms you want to use as you go. I'm hoping to get at least 5 Light, 5 Medium, and 5 Heavy forms (you can have one of each type) to access allowing the user to customize and create combos of their own choosing.\n\n",
