    "description": "This is the **SINGLEPLAYER** version of the map!<br>\n\n The zerg are coming, and you are the regional brigade's colonel in charge of defending your mountain pass. You will receive periodic reinforcements to build up your forces. Destroy the hive to complete the mission. However, do keep in mind that scouts report zergs starting to flank from behind... Your forces are comprised of siege tanks, marines, reapers, and medivacs. Siege tanks are in limited numbers, and periodically arrive from command HQ. Your barracks and starport also periodically generate troops. Your starport is also capable of calling in battlecruiser and banshees at a premium. Enemy reinforcements are received through a nydus network. Ultralisk caverns, infestation pits, and spawning pools also contribute to the flow of the enemy. **<br>\n\n YouTube Video
