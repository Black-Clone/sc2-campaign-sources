    "description": "**Path of Vengeance**<br>\n\n by Wakeman\n\nAvailable on North America and South-east Asia servers. Search \"path\" OR \"vengeance\", then look for the map Path of Vengeance.\n\n**Storyline:**<br>\n\n During the Zerg invasion of Aiur, Dark Templar Zeratul and his company set aside their long-term disagreement with Protoss of Aiur, the Khalai, and helped them.\n\nHowever, the fire of hatred was still burning violently in some other individuals. Ulrezaj, the leader of a Dark Templar secret society Fist of Ulrezaj, saw the downfall of Aiur as a good opportunity for their long overdue vengeance.\n\nTheir first step was to establish a primary base on Aiur under the cover of the rampaging Zerg.....\n\n**Features:**<br>\n\n \\- Melee combat ARPG map!<br>\n\n \\- Smooth third person view camera using WASD control.<br>\n\n \\- Numerous hero abilities.<br>\n\n \\- Several different minion fights and four unique boss fights!\n\n**Control:**<br>\n\n \\- Use \"W\", \"A\", \"S\", \"D\" to control Ulrezaj's movement.<br>\n\n \\- Use \"R\" and \"F\" to change camera views.<br>\n\n \\- Use Num Pad \"1\" to \"9\" and \"\\*\" to use abilities.<br>\n\n \\- Use \"1\", \"2\" to use Healthpack and Energypack respectively.<br>\n\n \\- Ulrezaj gains one skill point every time he gains a level. Skill points can be used to learn new spells.\n\n**General Tips:**<br>\n\n \\- Save regularly, especially before boss fights!<br>\n\n \\- Ulrezaj's spells are very powerful. Use them whenever you have enough energy.<br>\n\n \\- Due to limitations of the Starcraft 2 engine, you may find Ulrezaj's movement slightly laggy. If you find this unbearable, after downloaded the map at MULTIPLAYER, switch to SINGLE PLAYER => PLAY VERSUS A.I. => Look for \"Path of Vengeance\" => CREATE GAME, and the movement will become lagless!\n\n**Feedback / Contact:**<br>\n\n Please give me feedback by replying here or through e-mail: wakemanck@hotmail.com\n\n**Note:**<br>\n\n The story is created by me based on background from Starcraft: Brood War bonus campaign Enslavers: Dark Vengeance. It is NOT canon, so do not ask me where to find readings for the story or argue about the validity of it!<br>\n\n The name Kharondis was created by me. All other names were taken from the Starcraft universe.\n\n**Video:**\n\n**Screenshots**<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n",
