    "description": "# ****PERFECT SOLDIERS****\n\n*News: the nuke bug has now been fixed.*\n\n![null](<http://s2.postimg.org/pwvs3ueex/Logo_gray_background.jpg>)\n\n\"Perfect Soldiers\" is a 30-mission trilogy campaign consisting of 3 parts: Crimson Moon, Amber Sun and Aureolin Eclipse. The campaigns were not designed with sequels in mind, and yet sequels they acquired anyway, and now they're all gathered here together so that players can easily access them at the same place.\n\nAt the time of writing, this is an incomplete project. Crimson Moon and Amber Sun are done and ready to play, but Aureolin Eclipse needs its last missions finished. Those that are ready can be downloaded on this page. Also, note that the project may be subject to alterations even after all the missions are done.\n\n*Though this is primarily a terran campaign, there are some missions in Aureolin Eclipse that let you play as protoss.*\n\n### Story\n\n\"Perfect Soldiers\" has a dark, twisty story that's full of memorable scenes and moments, populated by characters that you will both care for and hate. The campaign begins at the intersection of two plotlines: a group of miners that have travelled to the remote world of Roverville in search for fortune, and a Crimson Moon assassin on the hunt for a dangerous terrorist threatening to bring chaos to the sector. As the story progresses, more and more characters enter... until the final showdown in Aureolin Eclipse's last mission.\n\n![null](<http://s3.postimg.org/iydp6oy83/Geraldus_Rose.jpg>)\n\n### How to play\n\n- Download the files to your computer, and unzip. \n- The maps should be placed in folders named \"Crimson Moon\", \"Amber Sun\" and \"Aureolin Eclipse\" (depending on which campaign you download) in the \"Maps\" folder. If the placement is wrong, the maps won't connect (but they can still be played). \n- No mod is required, except for Aureolin Eclipse. Place the file \"AEmod\" in the mod folder and you're good to go. \n- When starting the campaign, use the mission launcher, which lets you choose which mission you want to play. \n\n\n\n### Missions\n\n#### Crimson Moon\n\n1.
