    "description": "I finally got around to finishing this. This is the beginning of Metroid Prime 2 Echoes, ending with the first appearance of Dark Samus. It features icons from the Prime games, an Aether loading screen, and Trooper lore entries. There is no Scan Visor, instead you must walk into/over something and the original scans in the game will show up as text word for word. The lore entries are done as tips, so you need to have tip notifications enabled if you want to read them. Please tell me how you like it, and let me warn you in advance that I could not find a single doodad even remotely resembling the portal to Dark Aether, so I had to use purple fire instead. Yeah, I know. If only the editor had that Warcraft 3 poral doodad... \\*sigh\\* Anyway, I hope you enjoy it.\n\n![http://www.sc2mapster.com/media/images/42/878/Untitled.jpg](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/media/images/42/878/Untitled.jpg>)\n\n",
