    "description": "\n\n\n\n*Year 2488. After three years of fighting across the sector, the Guild Wars are winding down and the Kel-Morian Combine is losing ground on every front. All signs point to an inevitable victory for the Confederacy.*\n\n\n\n*Out of nowhere, Confederate outposts and key facilities on the strategically important colony of Sonyan are hit by a series of well-coordinated raids and bombings. These attacks are carried out by mercenaries believed to be contracted by the Kel-Morians. Confederate forces are placed on high alert and troops are diverted to Sonyan from neighboring colonies. Tensions are rising on some of the Confederate-occupied fringe worlds while Confederate intelligence is scrambling to get a read on the situation...*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### **What is this?**\n\n---\n\n\n\nA single-player campaign for Starcraft 2 with a story taking place during the Guild Wars, before the events of the original Starcraft.

There is no checkpoint system in place yet, so it is recommended to save often, especially on these maps.**\n\n\n\n### **Downloads**\n\n---\n\n[Quagmire v0.91](<https://www.sc2mapster.com/projects/quagmire/files/2594117>)\n\n[Quagmire v0.91 Assets](<https://www.sc2mapster.com/projects/quagmire/files/2594114>)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### **How to Play**\n\n---\n\n\n\n**You need to download both the mod pack and the maps to be able to play.**\n\n\n\n- Place the two .SC2Mod files in the \"Mods\" folder in your Starcraft 2 install directory.\n\n<!-- -->\n\nexample folder containing the mod files: C:\\Games\\StarCraft II\\Mods\n\n\n\n- Place the \"Quagmire\" folder containing the .SC2Map files in the \"Maps\" folder in your Starcraft 2 install directory.\n\n<!-- -->\n\nexample folder containing the map files: C:\\Games\\StarCraft II\\Maps\\Quagmire\n\n\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\n\n- You can create a shortcut and use it to play the mod directly.
