    "description": "Chapter\\_5: \"REVOLUTION\" \\_Remake SC1\\_ bÃªta version.\n\n\\-Original fitfh Terran mission scenario from SC1, with all dialogues and features.\n\n\\-Only original units, with the old tech tree. I bet you will start to feel back in the old days, with the apparition of the wraith, the dropship, Kerrigan ect...\n\n\\-Also, lot of added stuff, especially cinematics and secondary objectives.\n\n\\-More difficulty.\n\n\\-Known problems: -some dialogues during the game just do not want to work, I don't get why. -some bugs still, it is not the real final version. -I didn't manage to fix Kerrigan's Lockdown button.\t-Sometime the AI does strange things.\t-This is my second map, so please don't be too harsh!\n\nSo, try it if you want, and please tell me what you think about it!\n\n",
