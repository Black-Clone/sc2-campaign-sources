A little-known, warlike faction of the Protoss that has kept its existence secret from the rest of the Protoss. During the Aeon of Strife, they were known as the Laceros Tribe. But soon that name would be lost to the ashes of history and a new order would rise...\n\n*The Siege of Galilee* is a simple campaign map depicting a battle in the Aeon of Strife.\n\n\n\n**Credits**\n\nThanks to WingedArchon for the custom Kahlani model, and for creating the Talon faction that inspired this project.\n\n\n\n![null](<https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/224/800/talon-01-image-03.jpg>)\n\n![null](<https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/224/801/talon-01-image-04.jpg>)\n\n\n\n",
