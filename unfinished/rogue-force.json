    "description": "\n\nPrototype Level 1 demo of a campaign.\n\n\n\nPREVIEW:\n\n\"In-the-making\" video (spoilers - preferably wait until you've tried the level if you're curious.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGAMEPLAY CONCEPT: MANNABLE TURRETS:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMission is playable and completable, including cut-scenes.\n\n\n\nBUGS:\n\n\\- Your Marine Commander and units can actually walk through the Security Gate before it opens currently - DON'T DO IT, PRESERVE THE ILLUSION! D,:\n\n\n\n\\- Auto-Turrets are meant to be Mannable Turrets but it's not yet implemented.\n\n\n\n\\- Possibly one or two things I missed.\n\n\n\n\\- Many things yet to be implemented.\n\n\n\nPlease enjoy.\n\n",
