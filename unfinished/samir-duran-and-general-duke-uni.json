    "description": "This is the Portraits for General Duke and Samir Duran from Starcraft 1. Units aren't fully made the only reason for this map is to show the assets. I have a crappy Duke Marine skin that I made in 2 minutes but his portrait is for a tank or BC. Duran has the texture nad portrait for Concept art white and blue Duran, Concept art Duran with red beret, and Original Duran with custom armor and red beret. Duran looks best with dark green team color. The sounds for infested and regular Duran are also in the imported assets. Duke's tank and BC sounds are also there. You're more than welcome to use these assets for whatever you like as long as credits are given :D\n\nEnjoy!\n\n",
