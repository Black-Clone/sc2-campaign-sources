    "description": "Trying to create a map that contains SC1 units, SC2 units, SC2 campaign units, and SC2 hero units that level up with WC3 hero Style upgrading. I am trying to do it for all races. Also trying to make each race equal. I want to use all the SC2 campaign Terran units including the bunker. I am also looking for a expert to make the map switchable from TPS mode into RTS. I am also looking for a team of experts to help me out. This map would be a hecka fun map with all the best of parts of all the blizzard games.\n\n",
