Download the Ascendency mod (needed for missions 3 and onward)\n\n2\\. Place the mod in your SC mods folder (should be in program files)\n\n3\\. Download the mission you want to play\n\n4\\. Launch it in the editor\n\nSpecial thanks to CybrosX for making some custom models for Missions 2 and 3! Check out his model showcase here!\n\n[CybrosX's Model Showcase](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/forums/development/artist-tavern/125735-cybros-x-model-showcase/#p10>)\n\n",
