Both of them were awesome about letting me use their stuff to put this thing together. These are originally Ultraling's maps, found here in sc2mapster. I picked them up a long time ago and slowly worked on them, editing terrain, adding all kinds of flavor here and there, including Maverck's Brood War mod, and this is the result.\n\n#### Features\n\n- all 10 original missions + the tutorial \n- original SC1 units and structures with original stats, including custom models \n- original SC1 Terran soundtrack \n- all the dialogue, voice acting & other miscellaneous text from the original campaign \n- classic unit decals, such as Alpha Squadron, Sons of Korhal etc. \n\n<!-- -->\n\n#### \"Artistic License\"\n\n(some notable differences from the original campaign)\n\n- Medics - to balance out the units Brood War style, and to provide more options to the player \n- extra \"hero\" abilities: Kerrigan has the snipe ability, Raynor can replenish Spider Mines \n- Mission 4 \"The Jacobs Installation\" - third person mode (optional) \n- two difficulty levels - with a somewhat more aggressive AI than in the original, in order to provide some challenge to the average player \n\n<!-- -->\n\n#### Downloads\n\nLinks to the latest versions, by language. You will need both the maps and the mod file to play (see \"How to play\" below).\n\nPLEASE NOTE that for the latest versions and the Campaign Launcher, you will also need the latest (or at least close to latest) version of Starcraft 2. For older versions, check the \"Files\" section.\n\n**English version**\n\n- [Map pack](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/maps/sc1-episode-1-rebel-yell/files/28-rebel-yell-v1-5-1/>) \\- v1.5.1 \n- [Mod file](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/maps/sc1-episode-6-queen-blades/files/17-sc1bwmod-v4-7b-english/>) \\- v4.7b \n- [Mod file (for grid hotkeys)](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/maps/sc1-episode-6-queen-blades/files/16-sc1-mod-v4-7-optimized-for-grid/>) \\- v4.7 \n- [Campaign Launcher](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/maps/sc1-episode-6-queen-blades/files/3-scmr-campaign-launcher-v1-1-english/>)\n\n<!-- -->\n\n<pre></pre>\n\n**French version**\n\n- [Map pack](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/maps/sc1-episode-1-rebel-yell/files/29-rebel-yell-v1-5-1-french/>) \\- v1.5.1 \n- [Mod file](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/maps/sc1-episode-6-queen-blades/files/11-sc1bwmod-v4-6-french/>) \\- v4.6 \n- [Campaign launcher](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/maps/sc1-episode-6-queen-blades/files/13-scmr-campaign-launcher-v1-1-french/>) \\- v1.1 \n\n<!-- -->\n\n<pre></pre>\n\n**German version**\n\n- [Map pack](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/maps/sc1-episode-1-rebel-yell/files/31-rebel-yell-v1-5-1-german/>) \\- v1.5.1 \n- [Mod file](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/maps/sc1-episode-4-stand/files/28-sc1-mod-v4-7b-german/>) \\- v4.7b \n- [Campaign launcher](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/maps/sc1-episode-1-rebel-yell/files/32-scmr-campaign-launcher-german/>) \\- v1.1 \n\n<!-- -->\n\n<pre></pre>\n\n**Russian version**\n\n- [Map pack](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/maps/sc1-episode-1-rebel-yell/files/30-rebel-yell-v1-1-russian/>) \\- v1.1 \n- [Mod file](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/maps/sc1-episode-6-queen-blades/files/10-sc1bwmod-v4-6a-russian/>) \\- v4.6a \n- [Campaign launcher](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/maps/sc1-episode-6-queen-blades/files/5-scmr-campaign-launcher-v1-1-russian/>) \\- v1.1 \n\n<!-- -->\n\n<pre></pre>\n\n**Italian version**\n\n- [Map pack](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/maps/sc1-episode-1-rebel-yell/files/20-rebel-yell-v1-05-italian/>) \\- v1.05 \n- [Mod file](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/maps/sc1-episode-1-rebel-yell/files/21-sc1-mod-v4-2-italian/>) \\- v4.2 \n\n<!-- -->\n\n<pre></pre>\n\n**Korean version**\n\n- [available here](</linkout?remoteUrl=http%253a%252f%252fstorycraft.ivyro.net%252f>)\n\n<!-- -->\n\n<pre></pre>\n\n#### How to play\n\n- extract the mod file (SC1BWmod) to your \"Mods\" folder in your Starcraft 2 install directory (NOT the folder under \"My Documents\") \n- extract the map pack to the \"Maps\" folder in your Starcraft 2 install directory (create the folder if it doesn't exist) \n- extract the Campaign Launcher & setup to the same \"Maps\" folder (not the campaign folder) \n\n<!-- -->\n\n**Campaign Launcher installation:**\n\n- launch the Starcraft 2 editor \n- open the setup map named SCMRsetup in your Maps folder and click the \"test document\" button on the top right (or press ctrl+F9) \n- wait until the launcher loads and you're at the title screen, then save the game and exit the map (press esc or F10 to open the game menu) \n- find the save file (named \"Starcraft - Mass Recall\" by default) in (your home/documents folder)/Starcraft II/Saves/VersusAI \n- copy or move the save file to the saves folder under your account folder (your home/documents folder)/Starcraft II/Accounts/.../.../Saves/Multiplayer (for example; any of the save folders will do) \n- Done! You can now log into the appropriate account and load the save from the load game-screen. You can use this save to play each episode. \n\n<!-- -->\n\n**more info:**\n\n- You can copy the save file to whatever accounts you want. For example, if you want to play offline, copy it to your guest account folder. \n- If you're unsure of the right folders or can't find the Starcraft II documents folder, log into an account of your choice in SC2, go to the load game-screen, click on a save and click the \"show in folder\"-button.
