Uses the same mod file as the previous episode, and again, credit for the mod goes to MavercK. Also thanks to Ultraling for his initial work on the Terran episode, and GnaReffotsirk and others for the amazing unit models.\n\n#### Features\n\n- all 10 original missions \n- original SC1 units and structures with original stats, including custom models \n- original SC1 Zerg soundtrack \n- all the dialogue, voice acting & other miscellaneous text from the original campaign \n\n\n\n#### \"Artistic License\"\n\n(some notable differences from the original campaign)\n\n- Lurkers! Because who doesn't love Lurkers? \n- Mission 5 \"The Amerigo\" - yep, like it or absolutely hate it, the third person \"shooter\" action is back \n- two difficulty levels - with a somewhat more aggressive AI than in the original, in order to provide some challenge to the average player \n\n\n\n#### Downloads\n\nLinks to the latest versions, by language.

You can now log into the appropriate account and load the save from the load game-screen. You can use this save to play each episode. \n\n\n\n**more info:**\n\n- You can copy the save file to whatever accounts you want. For example, if you want to play offline, copy it to your guest account folder. \n- If you're unsure of the right folders or can't find the Starcraft II documents folder, log into an account of your choice in SC2, go to the load game-screen, click on a save and click the \"show in folder\"-button. It will take you to the appropriate saves folder. \n\n\n\n#### Troubleshooting & known issues\n\n- [Troubleshooting/Frequently Asked Questions](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/maps/sc1-episode-1-rebel-yell/pages/troubleshooting-faq/>)\n- [Known Issues](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/maps/sc1-episode-1-rebel-yell/pages/known-issues/>)\n\n\n\n#### Credits\n\n- Original campaign by Blizzard \n- Remake by Jones \n- The original mod \"[Starcraft 2 Brood War](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/maps/brood-war-1-5/>)\" by MavercK \n- with additional tweaks by christdaugherty, Superfield, Jones, Telenil, Jimm \n\n\n\n**custom models/textures**\n\n- GnaReffotsirk (Carrier, Shuttle, Queen, Guardian) \n- Snowflake Entertainment/Project Revolution (Reaver, Corsair, Defiler, Valkyrie), reworked by GnaReffotsirk (with help from NiNToxicated, DeveRR0, Phygis) \n- GhostNova91 (Devourer, Raszagal / Female High Templar, Duran portrait, Protoss / Xel'Naga Temple, UED flag) \n- buhhy (Dragoon) \n- SoulFilcher (Ion Cannon, Duran hero icon) \n- Thrikodias (Observatory, Psi Emitter, Xel'Naga Stasis Cell) \n\n\n\n- Alpha & Omega Squadron decals by TooMuchTuch \n\n\n\n<pre></pre>\n\n- Third Person Shooter engine by martinolsson \n- easy difficulty & other miscellaneous tweaks by Telenil \n- French translation by Choum28 \n- Russian translation by Jimm3110, Virussoft (original translation & dubbing: Fargus Multimedia, 7Wolf) \n- Italian translation/modification by Zarxiel93, TheTorrasque, JustSkorpyon \n- German translation by FirefoxGhost \n- Korean translation by storycraft \n- as always, thanks to Hati for his SC2 Localizer \n\n\n\n**Music**\n\n- Starcraft soundtrack by Derek Duke, Glenn Stafford, Tracy W.
