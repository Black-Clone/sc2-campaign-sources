Nostalgic, faithful to the original, surprisingly fresh at the same time and most of all fun to play are the things I was going for when creating it.\n\nThanks to a bunch of people including but not necessarily limited to Telenil, christdaugherty, Superfield, Jimm3110, Ultraling, Maverck, GnaReffotsirk for their feedback and/or other (direct or indirect) contributions to this little project. Also thanks to my brother for all the playtesting I made him do, and thanks to all you people for the feedback/support and/or just general interest in the project. Much fun was had making the campaign (among other things), I hope you'll have at least as much fun playing.\n\n#### Features\n\n- all 8+1 original missions \n- original SC1 units and structures with original stats, including custom models \n- original SC1 Terran soundtrack \n- all the dialogue, voice acting & other miscellaneous text from the original campaign, and more \n- classic UED unit decals \n- two difficulty levels (maps tested exclusively on Stukov (harder) difficulty, so you can consider it the \"default\" difficulty) \n\n\n\n#### \"Artistic License\"\n\n(some notable differences from the original campaign)\n\n- two difficulty levels - with a somewhat more aggressive AI than in the original, in order to provide some challenge to the average player \n- all kinds of cinematic/cosmetic flavor \n- Duran has the snipe ability because why not \n\n\n\n#### Downloads\n\nLinks to the latest versions, by language. You will need both the maps and the mod file to play (see \"How to play\" below). For older versions, check the \"Files\" section.\n\nPLEASE NOTE that for the latest versions and the Campaign Launcher, you will also need the latest (or at least close to latest) version of Starcraft 2.

You can now log into the appropriate account and load the save from the load game-screen. You can use this save to play each episode. \n\n\n\n**more info:**\n\n- You can copy the save file to whatever accounts you want. For example, if you want to play offline, copy it to your guest account folder. \n- If you're unsure of the right folders or can't find the Starcraft II documents folder, log into an account of your choice in SC2, go to the load game-screen, click on a save and click the \"show in folder\"-button. It will take you to the appropriate saves folder. \n\n\n\n#### Troubleshooting & known issues\n\n- [Troubleshooting/Frequently Asked Questions](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/maps/sc1-episode-1-rebel-yell/pages/troubleshooting-faq/>)\n- [Known Issues](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/maps/sc1-episode-1-rebel-yell/pages/known-issues/>)\n\n\n\n#### Credits\n\n- Original campaign by Blizzard \n- Remake by Jones \n- Mod by Maverck \n- additional mod tweaking by christdaugherty, Superfield, Jones, Telenil, Jimm3110 \n\n\n\ncustom models by\n\n- GnaReffotsirk (Carrier, Shuttle, Queen, Guardian) \n- Snowflake Entertainment/Project Revolution (Reaver, Corsair, Defiler, Valkyrie), reworked by GnaReffotsirk (with help from NiNToxicated, DeveRR0, Phygis) \n- buhhy (Dragoon) \n- SoulFilcher (Ion Cannon) \n- Thrikodias (Observatory, Psi Emitter) \n- GhostNova91 (Duran portrait) \n\n\n\n<pre></pre>\n\n- UED & Nova Squadron decals by TooMuchTuch \n- French translation by Choum28 \n- Russian translation by Jimm3110 (original translation & dubbing: Fargus Multimedia, 7Wolf) \n- Italian translation/modification by Zarxiel93, TheTorrasque, JustSkorpyon \n- Korean translation by storycraft \n- and of course thanks to Hati for his SC2 Localizer, so everyone can play the maps! \n\n\n\n**there's some music because I couldn't help myself:**\n\n- Starcraft soundtrack by Derek Duke, Glenn Stafford, Tracy W.
