You can now log into the appropriate account and load the save from the load game-screen. You can use this save to play each episode. \n\n\n\n**more info:**\n\n- You can copy the save file to whatever accounts you want. For example, if you want to play offline, copy it to your guest account folder. \n- If you're unsure of the right folders or can't find the Starcraft II documents folder, log into an account of your choice in SC2, go to the load game-screen, click on a save and click the \"show in folder\"-button. It will take you to the appropriate saves folder. \n\n\n\n#### Credits\n\n- Original campaign by Blizzard Entertainment \n- Remake by Telenil, Jones313 & Jimm3110 \n- additional terraining by TheTorrasque \n- The original mod \"[Starcraft 2 Brood War](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/maps/brood-war-1-5/>)\" by MavercK \n- with additional tweaks by christdaugherty, Superfield, Jones, Telenil, Jimm \n\n\n\n**custom models/textures**\n\n- GnaReffotsirk (Carrier, Shuttle, Queen, Guardian) \n- Snowflake Entertainment/Project Revolution (Reaver, Corsair, Defiler, Valkyrie), reworked by GnaReffotsirk (with help from NiNToxicated, DeveRR0, Phygis) \n- buhhy (Dragoon) \n- SoulFilcher (Ion Cannon, Duran hero icon) \n- Thrikodias (Observatory, Psi Emitter, Xel'Naga Stasis Cell) \n- GhostNova91 (Devourer, Raszagal / Female High Templar, Duran portrait, UED flag) \n- UED decals by TooMuchTuch \n\n\n\n**music**\n\n- Starcraft soundtrack by Derek Duke, Glenn Stafford, Tracy W.
