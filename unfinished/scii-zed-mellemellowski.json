    "description": "I got the idea for this mod - let's say 1 or 2 years ago - just in the moment sc2 was revealed by blizzard. Z is an old game released 1996 by The Bitmap Brothers ( [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z\\_(video\\_game](</linkout?remoteUrl=http%253a%252f%252fen.wikipedia.org%252fwiki%252fZ_(video_game>)) )\n\nI look forward to make the trigger system as simple as possible, so other user, that don't know the galaxy editor so well could download standard maps of mine and create their own StarCraft II Mod - Zed - Multiplayer Maps\n\nOtherside to the multiplayer part i will release the campaign of Z and Z: Steel Soldiers on my own. Also we plan do create a third part that will tell a new story on the z universe. Custom grafics and models in work.\n\nHere are my stats of progress:\n\nGameplay: 100% Units: 50% Structures: 25%\n\n\\-mellowski\n\nTech Demos\n\nDialog: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8ffolhZ8vE](<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8ffolhZ8vE>)[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZmqi4Vpp\\_U](<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZmqi4Vpp_U>) (new style)\n\nThe Radar sector [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCbnY8TXERc](<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCbnY8TXERc>)\n\nInfantry (without custom models at the moment) [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKRgut024No](<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKRgut024No>)\n\nRobot Factory + enemie occupies own sector [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEsOk7Z8ZNM](<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEsOk7Z8ZNM>)\n\nPick up grenades and throw them onto buildings to damage and destroy them [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5bnhwZiCkI](<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5bnhwZiCkI>)\n\nPick up grenades and throw them onto walls to destroy them, walk through afterwards [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZTxsSnOJxM](<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZTxsSnOJxM>)\n\n",
