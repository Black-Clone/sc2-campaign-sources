    "description": "*\"Make your way to safety through hordes of hellish monsters.*\n\n*Destroy your foes with different kinds of missile spells. Drop pallisades and explosives to create deadly bottlenecks to your advantage - but conserve your energy.\" *\n\n\\-\n\nThis is a project I started on this autumn. It features some custom button images, custom minimap image, Diablo-inspired combat (with custom left-click missiles) with mouseover heatlh bars and more.\n\nBasically, the general gameplay is heavily insipred by Left 4 Dead, as you and up to 3 more friends can bunch up to try and reach the end of this campaign through hordes of monsters.\n\n\\-\n\n**Update 28/9: Published patched version @ EU!** (hopefully bug-free, but who knows?)\n\n",
