    "description": "This is my remake of the mission Dark Origin in Brood War reuploaded. I've replaced the Castanar stasis tank doodads with the proper HotS destructibles. Everything checks out, except that Zeratul's \"Audacity\" line does not work, and I cannot replace the file at this time. Other than that everything is just peachy. Enjoy!\n\n\n\n",
