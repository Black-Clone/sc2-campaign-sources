    "description": "Starting with this fourth mission in Legacy of the Void, I decided to take a break from the main story and focus on the most underrated and mistreated character of all time: Nova. So begins a sort of subplot about Nova trying to reclaim her past with Zeratul's help. In this mission, you control both characters and must get them to the objective point. Zeratul is the more fragile of the two, so be careful. I have modified Nova's snipe ability to work on mechanical units, but sadly not structures, so those cannons must be taken out the hard way. Use Zeratul's void prison on them. Use snipe to take down observers. Enjoy!\n\n\n\n",
