    "description": "I decided to see if I could make a cinematic, and it somehow became this. My goal is to make a complete music video made of 100% triggers, no editing involved. I can't really type out a great description as it's 2 in the morning right now, but take a look at the preview, this took me about 2 1/2 hours. (1 hour to learn cinematic triggers, 1 hour to put it all together)\n\n",
