    "description": "A set of maps that are planned to be released together this summer. It will probably feature full-voice acting, new custom units and structures, an expected 30 episodes (missions) length campaign, and much more. It may also feature cut scenes and more.\n\nNote, I am hoping to assemble some sort of a team to work on this project. Positions: Artist? - Modeler? - Experienced Terrain Engineer - Experienced Data Engineer - Experienced Trigger Engineer - Story-line Designer -\n\nI currently fill all of these positions, but it is a little bit overwhelming. Help would be appreciated.\n\n",
