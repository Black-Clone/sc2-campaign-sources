    "description": "Well, I made this a little while ago.. Finished it on about the 2nd of August, but wasnt aware that someone else on here had already remade it, which is disappointing :(.. oh well.. Anyway, figured i'd still share it..\n\nMaking this map has certainly been interesting, discovering how to use the Galaxy editor after having only basic experience with the SC1 editor as been quite the challenge, but i think it has turned out nicely. Though I just wish I had-had an idea on how to do the Mission Briefing part of the level, Before looking at the other remake, xP\n\nAnyhow, here it is, cinematics an-all. Hopefully i didnt go overboard with them, but i'm pretty happy with it. I tried to keep it very faithful to the original level, so there arent all that many differences, but yeah.. I hope you like it heh xD.\n\nAlso, here is a youtube video of the map if you cant be bothered to download it <span>;)</span>\n\n[http:*www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL5aRvKgZO8&hd=1*](<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL5aRvKgZO8&hd=1>)\n\n",
