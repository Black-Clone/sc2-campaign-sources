    "description": "Hi guys. This is a remake of the first Zerg mission Among the Ruins where Daggoth teaches you the ropes. The original transmissions are there, but since there's no cerebrate portrait, I had to make do with that of an Overseer. Daggoth's first line will start at the beginning, and he'll tell you to make an Overlord when you collect 150 minerals. Unfortunately, I cannot for the life of me figure out how to make it so he tells you about buildings after you've made an overlord, so after he's done telling you to make an overlord, the one you already have will die, and that will cause him to tell you about structures. Sorry, but it's the best I can do. To hear Zasz tell you your objective, simply tell your hatchery to become a lair. Oh, and the chrysalis is an Overseer cocoon. Tell me what you think and enjoy!\n\n\n\n",
