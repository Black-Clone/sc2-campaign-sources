    "description": "The Iron Wolves Standalone missions are a series of scenarios featuring the mercenaries and their operations.\n\n\n\nThese missions are meant for those who have some experience playing Starcraft and enjoy having a few one-off scenario maps to play. Other maps are in the pipe as well, keep an eye out and enjoy the game!\n\n\n\nIn the current pack there are 4 maps. In order they are:\n\n\\- Cavalry Coming (Single Player, Macro Base Defense and Tug-of-war)\n\n\\- Power Grab (Single Player, Macro Objective Capture)\n\n\\- Burning Sands (Single Player, Macro Rescue Operation)\n\n\\- Deserted (Single Player, Macro Dual-Race Objective Capture)\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease, let me know if there are issues on any of the maps. Refinement is a process that a single person cannot do alone.\n\n",
