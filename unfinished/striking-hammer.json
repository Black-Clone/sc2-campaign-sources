    "description": "My first attempt at a campaign mission. It is pretty easy so but I'm working on the others and I plan for about 8 more, which will get increasingly difficult. Please give feedback and report any bugs or glitches to me so I can fix them.\n\nStory: A war has broke out, in the Dorano sector for control over it. Scattered across the sector, are 3 Exodus crystals, that when combined, would give ultimate power to the user. The Republic, a dictatorship, plan to use these crystals to strengthen their leader and ensure control. The Freelancers, a group of freedom fighters, plan to trade them to the Anerin' Combine Protoss for a quick profit, and to ensure their own freedom. You, must now choose to either stay loyal to the Dictator, or loyal to yourself.\n\nMission 2 can be found here [http://www.sc2mapster.com/maps/repulsion/](<http://www.sc2mapster.com/maps/repulsion/>)\n\n",
