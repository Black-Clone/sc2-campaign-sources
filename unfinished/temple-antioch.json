    "description": "\n\nRecreation of The Temple of Antioch mission from Starcraft 1, made to look in its Legacy of the Void state, abandoned and overgrown with lush vegetation.\n\nI didnt add any Zerg bio-mass or creep, to keep the map pure of possible storyline elements that might shape area's of conflict or other story specific layouts, to save time if someone wanted to modify this map for actual use.\n\nMinor alterations to mineral distribution and gas count as well inside the temple, just to shape where I placed the \"Command Center\\Nexus\\Hatchery\" doodad inside the temple, even though technically the entire mineral and gas vein would be gone at this point of the lore.\n\nAlso missing bridges, because... ya. Might just add a dirt walkway later and add doodad border along it, but for now, I kept it without.\n\n\n\n",
