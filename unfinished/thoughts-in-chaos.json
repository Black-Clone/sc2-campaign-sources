Created in collaboration with Ruben Moreno and Eric Dieter, the creators of the first two episodes, this campaign is the product of three years of development and a team of over twenty people. Come visit us on our new Discord to share your thoughts, bugs, or just chat. [https://discord.gg/m4wCpSf](<https://discord.gg/m4wCpSf>)\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Installation Instructions\n\nDownload the most recent map and mod ZIP files from the [files tab](<https://www.sc2mapster.com/projects/thoughts-in-chaos/files>).
