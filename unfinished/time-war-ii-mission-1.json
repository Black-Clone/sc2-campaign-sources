    "description": "## Introduction:\n\nThis is my first serious map project for StarCraft II. I've always enjoyed the campaign aspect of StarCraft and have played through both the Wings of Liberty and Heart of the Swarm campaigns several times. I therefore decided it was time to create my own.\n\n12 years ago together with friends we created a campaign for StarCraft 1 Now is the time to continue our work :)\n\n## Features:\n\nTime War II is a story that is not associated with the orginal starcraft campaign, there is nothing to do with her, and some of the names are the same accident The campaign is to be humorous and not very serious, but made with great passion and attention to detail.\n\n## Story:\n\n20 years ago during the events of the Time of War 1 campaign our heroes encounter on your way Jim Raynor, because he wants to prevent them from defeating the mad Zerg, They have to kill him\n\nNow his son John \"RAMBO\" Raynor wants revenge\n\n## Intro\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTvMHgQu7yI&list=PLYkhoYteoy2FRu9tZCm2ik5e-JKRYS8\\_K](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTvMHgQu7yI&list=PLYkhoYteoy2FRu9tZCm2ik5e-JKRYS8_K>)\n\n## Missions:\n\n- Time of War II 01: Hard landing (BETA) \n- Time of War II 02: To the caves (BETA) \n- Time of War II 03: The end of rebellion (BETA)\n\n<!-- -->\n\n",
