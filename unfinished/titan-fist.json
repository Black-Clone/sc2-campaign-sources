    "description": "Second part of \"Children of the Void\" series. Sequel to \"The Hungry Swarm [Wastelands]\".\n\nA long time ago, a UED expedition has come to Koprulu sector. It was desintegrated. But there were several people who uncovered a horrible truth behind the UED and their attack on Koprulu...\n\nThe map's using a unique trading system (at least i've written it on my own and never seen anything like this before). <br>\n\n Should be fun for BW fans - that's why it's called so.\n\nCurrently EU only.<br>\n\n[starcraft://map/2/148245](<>)\n\n",
