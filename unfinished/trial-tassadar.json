    "description": "This is a remake of the Trial of Tassadar mission in the original starcraft, based off of neodym's map \"temple of lore\". There are three allied groups of enemy protoss guarding the prison cell (a giant cybernetics core) in the center: pink, orange, and brown. You are blue and must cut your way thru tons of baddies to get to Tassadar's cell, which you must destroy. As always, the original dialogue is featured, with a high templar as Aldaris and a dark templar as Zeratul. Enjoy!\n\n\n\n",
