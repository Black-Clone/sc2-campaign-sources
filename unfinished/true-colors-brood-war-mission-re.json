    "description": "This is a remake of the True Colors mission in Brood War. Kerrigan's portrait is a Queen, Mengsk is an SCV, Fenix is an immortal, Duke's is a battlecruiser. Sorry, but that's what happens when Blizzard is too lazy to put hero units in the beta. The original audio is present, however. Two of the mutalisks you start out with are required for the \"greeting\" transmissions with Duke and Fenix. I have no idea which two, it could be any two of them, so upgrade air to the max (won't take long with my \"modifications\" to the research times lol!) before sending the fleet out.\n\n![http://samods.org/staff/magic/articles/bw_campaign/Brood_War.jpg](<http://samods.org/staff/magic/articles/bw_campaign/Brood_War.jpg>)\n\n",
