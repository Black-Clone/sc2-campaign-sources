    "description": "It's been a while since I made a map, but I'm back. This is a remake of the True Colors mission in Brood War. I did this before a long time ago in the beta, but now I've made a new one. It has all the dialogue of course, and Duke's portrait is the mercenary battlecruiser Jackson's Revenge. Fenix is a Dark Immortal, you'll know him when you see him. Note that I used someone else's map (terrain speaking) as a template, but I forget whose. So if you recognize the terrain in the map as yours, I give full credit to you.\n\n![fenix](<http://static.sc2mapster.com/content/images/30/576/Untitled.jpg>)\n\n",
