    "description": "\"Assault an entrenched Terran army extracting secrets from long-lost Protoss libraries on the planet Zhakul'das. Eisenkhul, a well-trained and experienced Dark Templar, leads a small force to wedge a forward position amidst the Terrans. After an initial scouting report, the force has landed planet side, with reinforcements on awaiting the command to follow, but things still appear uncertain.\"\n\nMy second map, a little larger and longer than the first (and hopefully more challenging!). I could definitely use some feedback on any aspect of it; and hopefully there are no bugs. If there's good praise, I may lay some story out and tie it in to another map I'm working on.\n\n",
