    "description": "Mapsters is a single player campaign where the characters are primarily named from users on some random website (or variations thereof). It primarily follows the story of Wargirl, a broodmother, and her Lieutenant, Hockleberry. Wargirl is a middle management broodmother who intends on making her way up the ladder, perhaps even to head advisor to the Queen of Blades one day.\n\n\n\nMission 1: Vespene Warlord<br>\n\n American Arcade Link: [battlenet://starcraft/map/1/263246](<>)<br>\n\n European Arcade Link: [battlenet://starcraft/map/2/184852](<>)<br>\n\n Jayborino Playthrough: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TT\\_Kf\\_orpIU](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TT_Kf_orpIU>)\n\n![https://media-elerium.cursecdn.com/attachments/160/400/BioDome.jpg](<https://media-elerium.cursecdn.com/attachments/160/400/BioDome.jpg> =800x600)\n\nThe zerg have received intel that there is a terran enemy conducting strange vespene experiments.
