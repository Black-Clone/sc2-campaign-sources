    "description": "## Introduction\n\nVortex of the Void is a 6 mission Protoss campaign about Tedis, a High Templar, and her hunt after Mal'Zar, who is attempting to resurrect his master Ulzar, The Dead God. This campaign takes place a few years after the largest Protoss battle in the galaxy took place: the Shadow Templar, Ulzar, was defeated on Aiur. Now his slave, Mal'Zar is gathering the shadow energy to bring his master back to life. His Rebirth can start a second eternal conflict. Tedis wants to stop this coming darkness and make eternal peace in the galaxy. She knows, there is a still chance to set the victory flag.\n\n## Features\n\n- A lot of new models \n- New Characters \n- In action already existing one (Artanis, Zeratul) \n\n<!-- -->\n\n## Characters\n\n- Tedis \n- Zeratul \n- Mal'Zar \n- Ulzar \n- Executor \n- Artanis \n- Bradis \n\n<!-- -->\n\n## Missions\n\n- Void 01 - Whisper of Shadows (Finished) \n- Void 02 - Inside of Evil (Finished) \n- Void 03 - The Ally Strike (Finished) \n- Void 04 - The Hour of Doom (Finished) \n- Void 05 - The Sky is Falling (Finished) \n- Void 06 - Echoes of the Ice (Finished) \n\n<!-- -->\n\n## Prologue - Shattered Void\n\n- Prologue 01 - Rules of Darkness (Finished) \n- Prologue 02 - Corrupted Lands (Finished) \n\n<!-- -->\n\n## Difficulty Levels\n\n- Casual: A difficulty requiring little to no multitasking and micro skills, featuring less enemies and focus on story. \n\n<!-- -->\n\n- Normal: A difficulty requiring minor multitasking and micro skills, featuring fewer enemies and focus on story and minor challenges. \n\n<!-- -->\n\n- Hard: A difficulty requiring good multitasking and micro skills, featuring a high number enemies and focus on challenges and entertainment. \n\n<!-- -->\n\n- Brutal: A difficulty requiring great multitasking and micro skills, featuring tremendously more enemies and heavy focus on challenge. \n\n<!-- -->\n\n## Screenshots & Videos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Prologue Mission\n\n\n\n## Credits\n\n- WarGirl \n- TaylorMouse \n- Hammer107 \n- GhostNova91 \n- Zowieberner \n- Thrikodias \n- SoulFilcher \n- SyCoAttack \n- Flinks and Luke Mancini \n- alleyviper85 \n- Comrade Crimson \n- StringStorm\n\n<!-- -->\n\n",
