    "description": "Basically in Warlords ORPG you control one main hero, who can not fight at all. But he's capable of controlling three monsters, which are heroes as well. The game is about catching new monsters, leveling, gearing and fusing them to evolve into even stronger and rarer ones. This idea is mainly from Monster Master RPG by Robbepop (back in Warcraft 3).\n\nI took his concept and added a few new key elements:\n\n- Every action has influence: Whatever you do in Warlords ORPG will be rated good or evil and the story will evolve in the according direction. I hope to increase the replay value. \n- Evil and good heroes may join forces with the human or zerg and engage in the war actively. This will be a pain to balance, but will also create some diversion from the standard ORPG routine. \n- Every player can design a personal home for their monsters, where they can heal, train or just relax. Personal homes are of course saved. \n\n<!-- -->\n\nGameplay video:\n\nAnother, more action-orientated gameplay video:\n\nWarlords ORPG UI\n\nAny feedback is appreciated. Greetings, Obatztrara\n\nPS: LOOKING FOR TESTERS!\n\n",
