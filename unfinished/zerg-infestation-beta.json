    "description": "Well, this is just my **BETA** for my now SC and SC2 map project. Which is also a fanfic... See some Terran colonists on Miranda found out that there was a [b]GIANT [/b]mining site and the colonists colonized it. They had highways and structure everywhere and had lots of bussiness until one day the Zerg came by and infested them and plan to mine it and conquer all of Terran in the sector with the rescources... But one colony stood defended and it's up to you to survive for 45 minutes until help arrives OR kill all Zerg! Good Luck... It may be a while before it is complete.\n\n",
