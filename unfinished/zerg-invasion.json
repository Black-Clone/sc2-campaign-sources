    "description": "This is a cooperative 2v1 map featuring two zerg players with infinite spawns attempting to invade a heavily fortified terran base. Units are more realistic, and their health, range, and armor reflects that.\n\nCurrently, the map is set for testing, so player 1 will receive all reinforcements, etc.\n\n",
