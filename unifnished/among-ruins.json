    "description": "UPDATE: I fixed the requirement problem so you can now make hydralisks. Sadly, burrow is still greyed out, but you don't really need it anyway.\n\nThis is a remake of the firt mission of the Zerg campaign. I used a very old map someone else made during the early stages of the beta to make this, but don't worry, it works fine. Original audio dialogue is present, with an Overlord portrait as Daggoth and an Overseer portrait as Zasz. Tech tree limitations are in place. The Roach Warren has been removed and the Hydralisk Den set in it's place.\n\n![http://static.sc2mapster.com/content/images/30/942/Untitled.jpg](<http://static.sc2mapster.com/content/images/30/942/Untitled.jpg>)\n\n",
