    "description": "Call of the Stars, is a campaign-type project, featuring Shal'Duris. A heroic dark templar, passing obstacles to find a cure for his old home planet. Artonia... This is a trilogy, each part will come with many maps. In the first part you play as the Shal'Duris himself, in the second you play as his ally. And in third of course, you play as terrifying zerg that conquered the planet and don't want to give it back! All the parts happened at the same time. But the thing is, first mission is maybe the same for all. But you need to win? See. You win as Shal'Duris forces, that means storyline goes into his bonus. You win as his allies? Maybe you want to steal the cure? Of course! Or you play as the zerg swarm? Go on and destroy protoss into ash!\n\nNext week i'll start working on the first mission, sorry for a long gap between the start of project and the first mission. Once the second mission is uploaded, use the Files menu under SCIIMapster logo. Because some players might look at this when the second or later maps is released.\n\n",
