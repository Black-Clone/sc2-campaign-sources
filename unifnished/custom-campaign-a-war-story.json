The campaign takes place 25 years after the end of Legacy of the Void, and as the name implies, it’s a story about the coming conflict in the Daeroloth Quadrant, a newly discovered part of the galaxy, far away from the Koprulu Sector, as factions seek to establish and take control of this vast, unknown space.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>Key Features:</strong></span>\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight:400\">Engrossing storyline split into several Acts, each seen with the perspective from a new faction’s eyes.</span>\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight:400\">8 unique factions with new unit and ability modifications, gameplay, stories and characters.</span>\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight:400\">Play as both Terran, Zerg and Protoss.</span>\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight:400\">Interesting gameplay mechanics presenting the player with a wide variety of scenarios requiring different skills and styles of play.</span>\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight:400\">Highly distinct difficulty setting, each with noticeably different levels of challenge and features between them.</span>\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight:400\">Plenty of references and connections to official StarCraft lore, making the world feel fleshed out and as if it fits in as part of the canon story.</span>\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight:400\">Heavy focus on cinematic experience by developing the story, the lore and its characters through the use of in-game cinematics and intermission maps.</span>\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight:400\">Unique campaign elements like upgradeable armies, mission launcher, connecting maps, briefing screens, victory/stat screens and achievements.</span>\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight:400\">A unique mission launcher featuring a data log, and an easily navigable way of selecting and playing any given map in an Act.</span>\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight:400\">Obtain Points through missions, bonus objectives, secrets and performance to unlock powerful upgrades to your growing army.</span>\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight:400\">Choose how you want the course of the story to go, by being presented with player choices that will change the course of the campaign’s plot development and its missions.</span>\n\n\n<!-- -->\n\n<span style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>Installation Guideline</strong></span>\n\n***More info coming soon...***\n\n<span style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>Plot Overview:</strong></span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight:400\">After Amon’s fall, the Koprulu Sector has been in a state of disarray, due to the massive destruction the Hybrid armies have caused across the sector. Casualties were many, and resources are scarce. As a result, millions of Terran, Protoss and Zerg in the Koprulu Sector began a mass exodus to establish a new and hopefully better future. Within the Daeroloth Quadrant, the races has been split into factions, each with their own unique combat style and history. This sector of the galaxy has proven to be ridden with resources and opportunities, and the factions vie for control of the quadrant’s various worlds - whether for personal gain, or for something greater.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight:400\">The Daeroloth Quadrant is now in a state of a widespread conflict. How will the factions handle the upcoming troubles heading their way? With the existence of player choice, you can decide the course of this campaign’s story!</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>Factions:</strong></span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight:400\">The campaign features 8 unique custom factions, all of which will be playable in one of the Acts. As progress is made on these factions, links will be added below to take you to a separate page where you can acclimate yourself with all the features, stories and gameplay mechanics of each faction. A video overview will also be provided when the time comes.<br></span>\n\n*<span style=\"font-weight:400\">Terran Factions:</span>\n\n*\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight:400\">Brotherhood of Taurus</span>\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight:400\">Forged Hand</span>\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight:400\">Greyhound Corps</span>\n\n\n<!-- -->\n\n*<span style=\"font-weight:400\">Protoss Factions:</span>\n\n*\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight:400\">Descendants of Aiur</span>\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight:400\">Shadow Hunters</span>\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight:400\">Servants of Daeroloth</span>\n\n\n<!-- -->\n\n*<span style=\"font-weight:400\">Zerg Factions:</span>\n\n*\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight:400\">Swarm Remnants<br></span>\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight:400\">The Ravagers</span>\n\n\n<!-- -->\n\n<span style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>Acts &amp; Missions:</strong></span>\n\n**Act I: Emerging Conflicts**\n\n*<span style=\"font-weight:400\">Play as the Brotherhood of Taurus</span>\n\n*\n\n*<span style=\"font-weight:400\">More info coming soon...</span>\n\n*<span style=\"font-size:18px\"><em><span style=\"font-weight:400\"></span></em></span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size:18px\"><em><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Difficulty Levels:</span></em></span>\n\n**Adventurer:**\n\n*<span style=\"font-weight:400\">Recommended if this is your first time playing the campaign, and you don’t have much experience in StarCraft II.</span>\n\n**<span style=\"font-weight:400\"><br></span>\n\n*\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight:400\">Enemy AI handicap set to 80.</span>\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight:400\">Hero in-combat health regeneration increased by 50%.</span>\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight:400\">Enemy AI has minimal upgrade and ability usage.</span>\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight:400\">Enemy AI sends smaller attack waves.</span>\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight:400\">Enemy AI will mildly try to counter the player’s composition.</span>\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight:400\">Many sections and map mechanics are altered or removed entirely.</span>\n\n\n<!-- -->\n\n**Veteran:**\n\n*<span style=\"font-weight:400\">Recommended if this is your first time playing the campaign, and you have experience in StarCraft II.</span>\n\n**<span style=\"font-weight:400\"><br></span>\n\n*\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight:400\">Hero out-of-combat health regeneration reduced by 25%.</span>\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight:400\">Hero cooldowns increased by 25%.</span>\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight:400\">Starting resources reduced by 15%.</span>\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight:400\">Enemy AI has common upgrade and ability usage.</span>\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight:400\">Enemy AI sends bigger attack waves.</span>\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight:400\">Enemy AI will regularly try to counter the player’s composition.</span>\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight:400\">Boss damage and health increased by 50%.</span>\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight:400\">Some sections and map mechanics are altered or removed entirely.</span>\n\n\n<!-- -->\n\n**Nightmare:**\n\n*<span style=\"font-weight:400\">Recommended if you have already beaten the campaign and you wish to challenge yourself.</span>\n\n*\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight:400\">Hero out-of-combat health regeneration reduced by 60%.</span>\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight:400\">Hero in-combat health regeneration removed</span>\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight:400\">Hero cooldowns increased by 50%.</span>\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight:400\">Starting resources reduced by 30%.</span>\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight:400\">Available resources reduced 10%.</span>\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight:400\">Enemy AI has exceptional upgrade and ability usage.</span>\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight:400\">Enemy AI sends very large attack waves.</span>\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight:400\">Enemy AI will heavily try to counter the player’s composition.</span>\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight:400\">Boss damage and health increased by 100%.</span>\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight:400\">Height advantage for the player is removed.
